# Welcome to my gallery of [Chart Glimpses](https://www.gitclear.com/help/share_progress_status_update_via_chart_glimpse_overview). 

You can set up your own Chart Glimpse -- [free forever](https://www.gitclear.com/pricing) -- over at [GitClear](https://www.gitclear.com).  

As of January 18 I'm still evaluating how often Github refreshes these images. On the GitClear side, the image content will change every hour, but since Github caches images, it's not yet clear to me the circumstances under which they refresh. I have determined that one way to force them to refresh is to call `curl -X purge [asset url]` [per SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26898052/how-to-force-image-cache-update-in-readme-rst-on-github), but I'm hoping that by setting a one hour cache expiration on the images, Github will refresh them periodically. Stay tuned for the thrilling conclusion.

The quantity being graphed by these charts is Line Impact -- see [docs](https://www.gitclear.com/line_impact_factors) or [two-minute Line Impact explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4n3AfEdhI&t=95s).

The picture of me and the unicorn is courtesy of the now defunct Background Burner, a product I built in 2014 to remove images from backgrounds (and replace them with funnier backgrounds). I hope to open source it when the opportunity allows.

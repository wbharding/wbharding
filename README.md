# Welcome to my gallery of [Chart Glimpses](https://www.gitclear.com/help/share_progress_status_update_via_chart_glimpse_overview). 

You can set up your own Chart Glimpse -- [free forever](https://www.gitclear.com/pricing) -- over at [GitClear](https://www.gitclear.com).  

The quantity being graphed by these charts is Line Impact -- see [docs](https://www.gitclear.com/line_impact_factors) or [two-minute Line Impact explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4n3AfEdhI&t=95s). 

Are you a dev that wants these? [Sign up for free](https://www.gitclear.com/pricing). We don't charge for dev/hobbyist plans + [comparatively cheap for commercial use](https://www.gitclear.com/developer_analytics_pricing_comparison). [Here is how you designate a commit or issue to be published to the graph](https://www.gitclear.com/help/publish_work_via_chart_glimpse).

GitClear updates these charts with fresh data every hour. Empirically, GitHub seems to cache them for about half a day at a time.

* Note that the final year is a projected estimate, derived by taking this year's Line Impact velocity and multiplying it by the fraction of the year still to come.

[The first empirical study published on Line Impact showed that it correlates with completed Story Points about 40% better than the next best git metric, Commit Count](https://www.gitclear.com/blog/line_impact_research_suggests_high_story_point_correlation_relative_to_other_git_metrics).
